# ios-app

### To clone a local copy of the xcode project onto your computer,
`git clone https://github.com/morningsignout/ios-app.git

### Once you have a local copy, 
**you MUST open ios-app.xcworkspace**. **NOT ios-app.xcodeproj.** This has to do with using Cocoapods as a dependency manager for the AFNetworking library.
